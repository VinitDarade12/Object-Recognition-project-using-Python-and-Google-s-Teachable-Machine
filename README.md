# Object-Recognition-project-using-Python-and-Google-s-Teachable-Machine

I recently completed an Object Recognition project using Python and Google's Teachable Machine. 
This project involved training a custom machine-learning model to identify and classify various objects accurately. 
Through this experience, I honed my Python programming, machine learning, and image processing skills. 

Key Highlights:
Developed and trained a custom object recognition model.
Utilized Google's Teachable Machine for model training.
Achieved high accuracy in object detection and classification.
Created a user-friendly interface for seamless image upload and recognition.
I'm thrilled with the results and look forward to applying these skills to future projects!
